    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that has become a staple in many
      households around the world. It is a layered pasta dish that typically
      consists of wide noodles, tomato sauce, cheese, and meat. The noodles are
      layered with the tomato sauce, cheese, and meat, then baked until the
      cheese is melted and bubbly. While the classic recipe includes ground beef
      or pork, there are many variations that use chicken, turkey, or even
      vegetables for a vegetarian option. Some recipes also include ricotta
      cheese, spinach, or mushrooms for added flavor and nutrition. Lasagna is a
      hearty and satisfying meal that is perfect for a cozy dinner with family
      and friends.

      Making lasagna from scratch can be a bit time-consuming, but it is well
      worth the effort. The first step is to prepare the tomato sauce, which
      usually involves saut√©ing onions and garlic in olive oil, then adding
      canned tomatoes, herbs, and spices. The meat is then cooked and seasoned
      before being added to the sauce. The next step is to boil the noodles
      until al dente, then layer them in a baking dish with the sauce and
      cheese. The process is repeated until the dish is full, then it is baked
      in the oven for 30-40 minutes until the cheese is melted and golden brown.
      The end result is a delicious and comforting meal that is sure to satisfy
      even the pickiest of eaters.
