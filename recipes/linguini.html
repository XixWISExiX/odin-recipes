    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Linguini is a type of pasta that originated in Italy, commonly referred to
      as "linguine" or "linguini fini". It is a long, thin and flat noodle,
      similar to spaghetti but wider in shape. The name "linguini" comes from
      the Italian word "lingua" which means "tongue", referencing the noodle's
      shape. Linguini is made from durum wheat semolina and water, and is
      typically served with seafood or tomato-based sauces.

      The texture of linguini is unique, as it is firm and chewy, yet smooth on
      the surface. Its shape makes it perfect for clinging onto sauces and
      ingredients, making each bite a perfect blend of pasta and flavor.
      Linguini dishes are a staple in Italian cuisine and are loved around the
      world for their versatility and simplicity. It can be served as a main
      course, side dish, or even as a salad. No matter how it is prepared,
      linguini is a delicious and satisfying addition to any meal.
